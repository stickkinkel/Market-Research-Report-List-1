<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flash Steam</li><li>Dry Steam</li><li>Binary</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The geothermal turbines market primarily comprises three types: Flash Steam, Dry Steam, and Binary. Flash Steam systems utilize high-pressure geothermal fluids that expand to produce steam, driving turbines. Dry Steam systems directly harness steam from geothermal reservoirs, offering a straightforward approach. Binary systems transfer heat from geothermal fluids to a secondary working fluid, which vaporizes and drives the turbine while maintaining the geothermal fluid's integrity. Each type caters to different geothermal resource characteristics and operational efficiencies.</p></p>

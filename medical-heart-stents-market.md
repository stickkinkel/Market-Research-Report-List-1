<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Heart Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li><li>Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical heart stents market comprises three primary types: Bare-metal Stents (BMS), Drug-eluting Stents (DES), and Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (BVS). BMS are simple metal tubes providing structure but lack medication to prevent restenosis. DES are coated with drugs that inhibit cell growth, reducing the risk of blockage. BVS are innovative, biodegradable structures that provide temporary support, eventually dissolving to restore natural vessel function. Each type serves specific patient needs, influencing adoption rates and market dynamics.</p></p>

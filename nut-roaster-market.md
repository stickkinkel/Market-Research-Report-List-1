<p><ul><li>Hot-Air Type</li><li>Direct-Fire Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nut roaster market comprises two primary types: hot-air and direct-fire. Hot-air type roasters use circulating heated air to roast nuts evenly, ensuring minimal oil absorption and preserving flavor. This method is often more energy-efficient and allows for precise temperature control. In contrast, direct-fire type roasters utilize flames to heat the nuts directly, resulting in a robust taste and potentially crispier texture.
